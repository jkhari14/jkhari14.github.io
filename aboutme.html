          <th>About Myself:</th>
          <td>I'm a Senior at Northwestern University, I major in Computer Science, and I would describe myself as a Team-goal oriented software engineer with an affinity for innovation, and an interest in Machine Learning
            and Data Science, and a fast learner that takes pride in surmounting new challenges. My affinity for the Computer Science field overall
            stems from me gravitating towards activities like solving puzzles and riddles or taking apart objects to see how 
            I could fix them or make them better, and also I would say it stems from the sense of pride I'd get from seeing 
            any ideas of mine come to life. My experience so far has mostly consisted of learning about program building, testing
            and debugging, memory management, and memory-efficient practices in coding, and then applying these concepts to projects 
            inside and outside of school including summer internships. I strive to be a team-goal-oriented software engineer that
            efficiently develops powerful, malleable code that is easy for others 
            to use and contribute to.</td>
